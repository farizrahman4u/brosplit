# Brosplit


A silly project combining two of my passions - bodybuilding and math.
Generates weight training schedule from custom rules using a variation of evolutionary strategies.

## Requirements

* numpy

## Usage

Edit `run.py` to add custom rules (emphasize a particular muscle, make sure 2 big muscles aren't trained on the same day etc).

```
python run.py
```
